# Reputation-based-Priotization-and-Resource-Allocation-RPRA-for-vehicular-fog-computing
Its a MATLAB simulation for ensuring trust and security based on reputation for vehicular fog computing enabled smart infrastructure.
The graphs are plotted using origin software... Below is the step-wise procedure to describe the process...
## Step 1: Use the following mentioned MATLAB file to to get the reputation values created by methods that are RPRA, IDES, TES, and CAWB techniques...
### a) RPRA_Vs_IDES18June2023.m
### b) TESAndRPRA25October2023.m and
### c) RPRA_Vs_Contextbasedhealthcare24October2023.m
## Step 2:
