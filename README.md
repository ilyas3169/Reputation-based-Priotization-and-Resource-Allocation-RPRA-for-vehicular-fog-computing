# Reputation-based-Priotization-and-Resource-Allocation-RPRA-for-vehicular-fog-computing
Its a MATLAB simulation for ensuring trust and security based on reputation for vehicular fog computing enabled smart infrastructure.
The graphs are plotted using origin software... Below is the step-wise procedure to describe the process...
## Step 1: Use the following mentioned MATLAB files to get the reputation values generated by methods that are RPRA, IDES, TES, and CAWB techniques... 
### a) RPRA_Vs_IDES18June2023.m
### b) TESAndRPRA25October2023.m and
### c) RPRA_Vs_Contextbasedhealthcare24October2023.m
Note that at present the generated reputation values are one of the main the criteria, that we followed to rank the performance of each method...However, another necessary to mention point is the plotting of the ranking of the RPRA in comparison to other benchmark methods directly from the MATLAB data file, that are:
### a) Workspace_RPRA_TES_IDES_CBAWUpdated25October2023V6.mat, 
### b) RPRA_Vs_IDES18June2023.mat, and 
### c) TrustVFCAllMethodsWithoutLog24October2023.mat
## Step 2: After running the above files and loading the above mentioned matlab files or only loading the above mentioned matlab files, now is the turn to identify the parameters and their values in a separate excel sheet. These parametes are:
### a) Parameter "yloggedreputTESAll" for reputation values for TES technique
### b) Parameter "AverageReputAllIDES" for reputation values for IDES  technique
### c) Parameter "SaveTotalTrustArray" for reputation values for CBAW  technique.... Yes the name of "SaveTotalTrustArray" is a little not similar to its technique, that is , CBAW...
## Step 3: After getting the fresh values by running the mentioned matlab files again and loading the corresponding matlab data (source files) or only retrieving the old values (as that of ours), now is the time to use the excel sheet for final graph generation.. The excel sheet can be imported to 'origin' software and relevant plot can be geneated. In our case we named the plot as "AggregateReputationValuesAllMethods11October2023".
